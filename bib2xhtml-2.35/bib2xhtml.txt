1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mbib2xhtml 22mconverts a bibtex-format bibliography file to XHTML.  4msource-0m
       4mfile24m may be either a BibTeX-format bibliography (1m.bib22m) file or a LaTeX-
       fomatted bibliography auxillary file (1m.aux22m).  4mhtmlfile24m	 will  often  be
       just  part  of  a  larger  XHTML file; 1mbib2xhtml 22mattempts to update the
       XHTML file in place.  It does this by searching 4mhtmlfile24m for  two  spe-
       cial  strings,  which delimit the bibliography part of the file.	 These
       strings are the XHTML comments

	      <!-- BEGIN BIBLIOGRAPHY 4mdelimiter24m -->

	      <!-- END BIBLIOGRAPHY 4mdelimiter24m -->

       If these delimiters are found, the old  bibliography  between  them  is
       replaced	 with  the  new bibliography.  Otherwise the new bibliography,
       with the appropriate delimiters, is appended to the  end	 of  4mhtmlfile24m,
       and  it	will  be  necessary to move it to the proper location by hand.
       Note that it is possible for 4mhtmlfile24m to contain any number	 of  bibli-
       ographies,  and	they  may be updated independently.  If no 4mhtmlfile24m is
       specified, the bibliography is written to standard output.

       The tag of each BibTeX bibliography entry  is  converted	 into  a  name
       anchor  (<A  NAME="tag">)  in  4mhtmlfile24m, and may be used to construct a
       link to this particular entry.

       By default the contents of the bibliography are determined by the  con-
       tents  of  the 4msourcefile24m.	It is also possible to specify the contents
       of the bibliography in the 4mhtmlfile24m itself by setting the 1m-i 22moption and
       using  two special strings to delimit the citations to be used for gen-
       erating the bibliography.  These strings are the XHTML comments

	      <!-- BEGIN CITATIONS 4mdelimiter24m -->

	      <!-- END CITATIONS 4mdelimiter24m -->

       If these delimiters are found, the contents between them	 are  searched
       for  XHTML  comments  containing the citations (one citation per line),
       for example

	      <!-- BEGIN CITATIONS 4mdelimiter24m -->

	      <!-- \citation{knuth:1997}
		  \citation{knuth:1984} -->

	      <!-- END CITATIONS 4mdelimiter24m -->

       These citations are then used for  choosing  the	 bibliography  entries
       from the 4msourcefile24m.

   1mSpecial Field Processing0m
       Several	BibTeX	fields are treated specially.  The filenames specified
       in the 1mpostscript22m, 1mpdf22m, and 1mdvi 22mfields are  relative  to	the  4mhtmlfile0m
       directory.   In	addition,  1mbib2xhtml	22mrecognizes compressed or gzipped
       files (those with filenames ending in 1m.Z22m, 1m.gz22m, or 1m.z22m).

       1murl	22mIf the 1murl 22mfield exists, a link (``A''	tag)  is  created.   The
	      destination  of the link is the 1murl 22mtag's value.  The bibliogra-
	      phy entry's title is the source of the link.  This can  be  used
	      to  create  a link to a XHTML version of the paper, or to a ver-
	      sion that is available by ftp.

       1mmailto 22mIf the 1mmailto 22mfield exists, a link (``A'' tag) is created.   The
	      destination of the link is the 1mmailto 22mtag's value.  The bibliog-
	      raphy entry's author name is the source of the link.

       1mpostscript0m
	      If the 1mpostscript 22mfield exists, its value is used as the name of
	      a	 PostScript  file.   1mbib2xhtml 22mcreates a link to the file, and
	      updates 4mhtmlfile24m with the number of pages and size of the  Post-
	      Script file.

       1mdoi	22mIf the 1mdoi 22mfield exists, its value is used as the designation of
	      a digital object identifier.  1mbib2xhtml 22mcreates a  link  to	the
	      object  through  4mhttp://dx.doi.org24m and updates 4mhtmlfile24m with the
	      1mdoi 22mas a hyperlink.	The 1mdoi 22mshould normally be in  a  canonical
	      form like the following: 4mdoi:10.1145/363347.363387.24m	However, if
	      the 1mdoi 22mdesignator is formed as an HTTP hyperlink,  it  will	 be
	      converted	 to  the canonical form by replacing the HTTP protocol
	      designation and the host name of the  hyperlink  with  the  4mdoi:0m
	      literal string.

       1mpdf	22mIf  the 1mpdf 22mfield exists, its value is used as the name of a PDF
	      (portable document format) file.	1mbib2xhtml 22mcreates	a  link	 to
	      the file and updates 4mhtmlfile24m with the size of the PDF file.

       1mdvi	22mIf  the 1mdvi 22mfield exists, its value is used as the name of a TeX
	      DVI file.	 1mbib2xhtml 22mcreates a link	to  the	 file  and  updates
	      4mhtmlfile24m with the number of pages and size of the DVI file.

       1mauthor22m, 1mkeywords0m
	      The  full	 1mauthor  22mand  1mkeywords 22mfields of each BibTeX entry are
	      included in 4mhtmlfile24m as XHTML comments, and may be used  by	CGI
	      scripts  (such  as  1mbibsearch22m, which is supplied) to select only
	      certain entries.

   1mHints0m
       1mbib2xhtml22m's LaTeX to XHTML conversion is not very smart.  If  something
       isn't being converted correctly, try doing it in a different way.

       1mbib2xhtml  22mdoes  not currently understand 4m\verb24m.  To get a tilde into a
       filename or an embedded URL, use 4m\~{}24m.  On the other hand, entries con-
       taining	4mURL24m  fields  or  4m\url{}24m commands, are correctly converted into
       hyperlinks.  Leave such hyperlinks as they are; do not embed any	 LaTeX
       commands in them.

       The  lists  that	 1mbib2xhtml  22mgenerates  contain  CSS hooks of the class
       4mbib2xhtml24m.	You can therefore modify the appearance	 of  the  lists	 by
       adding style entries like the following in the web page's header.
	      <style type="text/css">
		   dl.bib2xhtml dd { padding-bottom: 1em }
	      </style>

	      <style type="text/css">
		   ul.bib2xhtml li { padding-bottom: 1em }
	      </style>

       The  value  of  the  named attributes can contain arbitrary HTML markup
       commands, and can thus be used for substituting the  text  with	icons.
       For example, the following Unix command can be used for creating stand-
       alone PDF icons.
	   perl bib2xhtml -e 'nosize,nopages,PDF:<img src="pdficon_small.gif"
	     alt="PDF" border="0" />' example.bib example.html
       Unser the Windows shell the corresponding command would be.
	   perl bib2xhtml -e "nosize,nopages,PDF:<img src='pdficon_small.gif'
	     alt='PDF' border='0' />" example.bib example.html
       A couple of PDF icons and the conditions for their use are available at
       4mhttp://www.adobe.com/misc/linking.html#pdficon24m 4m.0m

       To  display  the	 number	 of  pages in local PDF files, the Perl module
       4mPDF::API224m must be installed on the system where 1mbib2xhtml	 22mis	running.
       A command like the following will accomplish this.
	   perl -MCPAN -e "install PDF::API2"


1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-a	22mInclude the BibTeX file's abstract field in the bibliography.

       1m-b 4m22mbibtex-options0m
	      Provide the specified options to the BibTeX program.

       1m-c	22mSort	 chronologically.   Normally,  the  bibliography is ordered
	      first by author and then by date.	 With this option, the	bibli-
	      ography is ordered by year, month, day, and then by author.

       1m-d 4m22mdelimiter0m
	      Specify  the  delimiter  that sets the bibliography off from the
	      rest of the XHTML file.  The default delimiter is	 the  name  of
	      the bibliography file with the 1m.bib 22mextension stripped.

       1m-D 4m22mmappings0m
	      Define  URL  to  directory mappings.  The 4mmappings24m argument con-
	      tains a sequence of comma-separated values.  Each value contains
	      a	 local	file path and the corresponding URL, separated by an 4m@0m
	      sign.  The resulting URL is used for linking the	various	 paper
	      file format types.

       1m-e 4m22mextended-information0m
	      Specify  how  an entry's extended information will be displayed.
	      The extended information is specified as a series of comma-sepa-
	      rated attributes.	 The following plain attributes are supported.

	      1mnotype 22mDo not display the file's type (PDF, Postscript, DVI).

	      1mnosize 22mDo not display the file's size in bytes.

	      1mnopages0m
		     Do not display the file's number of pages.

	      1mnocompression0m
		     Do not display the file's compression type.

	      1mnodoi  22mDo not display the file's DOI.

	      1mnobrackets0m
		     Do not enclose the DOI link or the file's extended infor-
		     mation in brackets.

       A number of valued attributes allow the specification of	 the  text  to
       display	for  various  file  types.   These are written as a 4mname24m:4mvalue0m
       pair.  The following names are supported for valued attributes.

	      o	     PostScript

	      o	     PDF

	      o	     DVI

	      o	     DOI
       1m-h 4m22mheading24m Use the string 4mheading24m instead of  the	 default  title	 when
       creating a new 4mhtmlfile24m.  If updating an existing 4mhtmlfile24m, this option
       is ignored.

       1m-i	22mThe citations are included in the 4mhtmlfile24m.  When this option is
	      set, the 4msourcefile24m must be a .bib file.

       1m-k	22mIn  labeled	styles	(1malpha22m, 1mnamed22m, 1mplain22m, and 1munsort22m) append to
	      the label of each entry its BibTeX key.  Thus, the label of each
	      entry  will  consist  of	the original label, followed by an em-
	      dash, followed by the BibTeX key.

       1m-m 4m22mmacro24m 4mfile0m
	      Specify a BibTeX macro file to supply to BibTeX when  processing
	      the  bibliography	 file.	 Macro	files  typically contain local
	      abbreviations and other macro definitions.

       1m-n 4m22mauthor24m 4mname0m
	      Specify an author name to	 highlight.   Any  bibliography	 entry
	      author  names that match the name specified as a regular expres-
	      sion will be set in HTML 4mstrong24m tags and will therefore be  dis-
	      played in a bold (or similar) font.

       1m-r	22mReverse the chronological sorting order.  Normally, the bibliog-
	      raphy is sorted (by year; BibTeX ignores	the  month)  from  the
	      earliest entry to the latest entry.  With this option, the order
	      is reversed.  Note that to  obtain  a  bibliography  ordered  by
	      chronological order you must also specify the 1m-c 22moption.

       1m-s 4m22mstyle0m
	      Create  a	 4mstyle24m-style bibliography.	 Supported styles are 1mempty0m
	      (the default),  1mplain22m,  1malpha22m,	1mnamed22m,  1mparagraph22m,  1munsort22m,  and
	      1munsortlist22m.	 An 1mempty 22mbibliography is a bulleted list.	 A 1mplain0m
	      bibliography is a numbered list.	1mparagraph 22mproduces just  para-
	      graphs  (no  bullets).   1munsort	 22mis	like  1mplain 22mexcept that the
	      entries in the XHTML file are in the same order as as  they  are
	      in  the source file.  1munsortlist 22mis like 1munsort 22mbut entry labels
	      are bullets instead  of  numbers.	  An  1malpha  22mbibliography	has
	      labels that are in the BibTeX alpha style.  A 1mnamed 22mbibliography
	      has labels of the form [name, year].

       1m-t	22mWrite a timestamp with the date at which  the  bibliography	was
	      updated to 4mhtmlfile24m.

       1m-v	22mReport version number on stderr.

       1m-u	22mConvert  LaTeX special characters into the corresponding Unicode
	      characters, and output XML coded in UTF-8.  The output  produced
	      by this option may be easier to parse and validate with some XML
	      parsers.	By default LaTeX special characters are converted into
	      HTML character entities.

1mFILES0m
       1mhtml-a.bst    22malpha XHTML BibTeX style file
       1mhtml-n.bst    22mnamed XHTML BibTeX style file
       1mhtml-u.bst    22munsort XHTML BibTeX style file
       1mhtml-aa.bst22m, 1mhtml-na.bst22m, 1mhtml-ua.bst0m
		     versions of the above style files with abstracts
       1mbibsearch     22ma CGI script for performing bibliography searches

1mSEE ALSO0m
       1mperl22m(L), 1mbibtex22m(L).

1mBUGS0m
       The LaTeX to XHTML translation, while decent, is not perfect.

       Requires	 bibtex and perl.  However, I think that most sites that would
       want to convert	BibTeX	to  XHTML  will	 already  have	both  programs
       installed.

       Relies on dviselect to count the number of pages in a DVI file.

1mHISTORY0m
       The program was originally written as 1mbib2html 22mby David Hull  in  1996,
       who  maintained it until 1998 (version 1.33).  In 2002, due to the lack
       of visible updates on the web, the program was adopted for maintenance,
       distribution,  and  further  evolution  by Diomidis Spinellis.  Changes
       made by him include support for XHTML 1.0 and documentation bug	fixes.
       The first public release of the maintenance effort was in 2004 (version
       2.1).  On March 2004 the program was renamed into  1mbib2xhtml  22mto  avoid
       confusion  with	projects  using	 the  name  1mbib2html .  22mPanos Louridas
       (4mlouridas@aueb.gr24m) added the functionality for including the  citations
       in the 4mhtmlfile24m 4m.0m
